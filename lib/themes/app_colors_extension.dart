/// `ThemeExtension` template for custom colors.
///
/// For example purposes, it has all required fields from the default Material `ColorScheme`.
/// But you can add, rename and delete any fields your need.
///
/// ### Motivation
///
/// At the beginning, you may not know if your colors will fit into the Material `ColorScheme`,
/// but you still decided to start using `ColorScheme`, and only then realize that you need additional fields.
/// You will create `ThemeExtension` for only the additional fields, and as the result, you will have your colors
/// scattered between the `ColorScheme` and `ThemeExtension` with a few extra colors.
///
/// With this template, you can collect all fields in one place,
/// and don't worry about future changes to the Material or your design.
///
/// Or you can just quickly copy-paste this file and rename fields to your needs.
